  NewsHeadline: New President Seems Promising
  NewsBody: The new President promised economic and social reform on the campaign
    trail, but has not provided a clear plan for how they will implement their ideas.
    The opposition has critisized them by saying, "They will just say whatever it
    takes to get elected." We will have to wait and see just how effective the new
    President actually is at making these changes.
