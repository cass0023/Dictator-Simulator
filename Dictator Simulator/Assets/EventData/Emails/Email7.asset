  EmailContents: "Yo President,\n\r\nThis is Hugo Saville! I own Daintree and have
    been meaning to talk to you for some time now. I LOVE what you've been doing
    so far in office and was hoping you'd be able to help me. \n\nI've been ripped
    apart with these taxes and was hoping you could help me along those lines ;)\n\r\nIf
    you choose to help me, you'll have a powerful friend in not only\n\r\nDaintree,
    but myself as well.\n\r\n- Hugo Saville\r\n\r"
