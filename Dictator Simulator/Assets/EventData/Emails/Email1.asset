  EmailContents: "To whom it may concern.\n\nDear President,\n\nCongratulations on
    becoming the President! We have offered to help every past President in their
    quest to power. Many have ignored our services for far too long, so I strongly
    advise you to agree to our help.\n\nTo start, we want to make you look better
    in the public eye. If you allow us to we will alter the media in your favour.\n\n\tIs
    this something you're interested in?\n\nThis will not be the last time you hear
    from us. Make sure to delete this email when you've answered. This stays between
    us!\n\n- Anonymous\n"
