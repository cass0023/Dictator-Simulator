  EmailContents: "Here a more in-depth description of each stat:\n\nSanity - How
    sane you are when making choices. Is it a sane or insane decision.\r\n\r\n\tEvery
    decision will affect Sanity in either a positve or negative \tway.\r\n\r\nApprovel
    - How much the contry approve of you as their leader. Are the choices you make
    what they want, or are you thinking about yourself?\r\n\r\n\tApprovel can change
    by how you display yourself in the media and on social media. If you post things
    that make you look good on the surface people will approve.\r\n\r\nTrust - How
    much the county trusts you to make decisions. Do they believe you have thier
    best interests at heart?\r\n\r\n\tTrust is affected by the executive orders you
    pass. Citizens want to reap the rewards of your decisons as well, so if you begin
    to take more for yourself they may begin to notice.\r\n\r\nFear - How much does
    the country fear you as a leader. Are your choices showing a dark pattern and
    will the population notice in time?\r\n\r\n\tFear is affected by the media, social
    media, and the executive orders you pass. Having high or low fear unlocks new
    decisions you wouldn't have other wise. To become a dictator you must you fear
    however you can.\n\nWe know you're gonna be great!\n\n- The country of Caecus"
