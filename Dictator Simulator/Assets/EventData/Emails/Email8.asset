  EmailContents: "Dear President,\n\nWe have some very angry parents on the phone
    talking about\nbooks they deemed \"inappropriate,\" and shouldn't be in schools.
    I went through the list and some feel like they shoudn't be banned but it's your
    call.\n\nHere are some examples:\n               - 1984 by George Orwell\n              
    - Animal Farm by George Orwell\n               - Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury\n              
    - The Handmaids Tale by Margret Atwood\n               - The Hunger Games by
    Suzanne Collins\n               - The Perks of being a Wallflower by Stephen
    Chbosky\n\nPick up the phone and let them know your decision.\n\n- Minister of
    Education"
