  EmailContents: "President,\n\nWe were talking to our leaders and have come to realize
    you need to reinstate the Death Penalty. It is too easy for criminals in Caecus
    to commit crimes, and by reinstating that punishment it will help your country
    as much as its helped ours.\n\nThis will not only improve crime rates, but also
    the economy in \nCaecus.\n\nWill you sign the order?\n\n- Anonymous"
